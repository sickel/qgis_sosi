# qgis_sosi
Handling of sosi format for QGIS

The present is an alfa version, only making a quite simple sosi line coverage, hardcoded parameters.

To run this: Select the line coverage that should be exported and run the sosilines.py script in the 
python console.

Further plans:
Implement exporters for other formats
Add more data
Rewrite as a QGIS plugin
